## What's inside?

- 1 R-file to extract the data from the original household_power_consumption.txt and write it to a txt file
- 1 txt file with the extract that is used to generate the plots
- 4 R-files to generate the plots (and that use the extract of the txt file)
- 4 plots

## Why did I do it like this? 

I've added the extra script and text file to save the data to generate the graphs because I like to keep the source data with my projects but the original file is too large to include it.
